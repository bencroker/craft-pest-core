# Logging in
You can log in users for your test by using the `->actingAs` method and it's companion `->actingAsAdmin` method.

## actingAs(markhuot\craftpest\factories\User|craft\web\User|callable|string|null $userOrName = NULL)
Acting as accepts a number of "user-like" identifiers to log in a user for the test. You may pass,
1. A user factory, `->actingAs(User::factory())`
2. A user, `->actingAs(User::find()->id(1)->one())`
3. A string that may be a username or email address, `->actingAs('my_great_username')`
4. A callable that returns a User element, `->actingAs(fn () => $someUser)`

## actingAsAdmin()
For many tests the actual user doesn't matter, only that the user is an admin. This method
will return a generic user with admin permissions. This is helpful for testing that something
works, not whether the permissions for that thing are accurate. For more fine-tuned permission
testing you should use `->actingAs()` with a curated user element.

## withToken(string $token)
For GQL requests (and other bearer token requests) you can set a token on the request by calling
`->withToken()` and passing a valid bearer token.
```php
$this->withToken($token)->get('/')->assertOk();
```
